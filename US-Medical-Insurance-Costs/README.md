# US-Medical-Insurance-Cost
I utilized US medical insurance data to analyze different variables to hypothesize different contributing factors to high insurance costs. 
Some of the variables were age, sex, smoker status, Bmi, etc. 
I used multiple python libraries such as matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, os, etc.
